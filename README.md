  <sup><sub>FIND SUBDOMAINS USING CLOUDFLARE</sub></sup><br></h1>
  
This tool performs subdomain enumeration on a given domain using Cloudflare's DNS scanner. *That's it.* 

Written in Python and designed for penetration testers and bounty hunters, this script will (1) create a Cloudflare zone for a given domain, (2) scan for DNS records, (3) save any records found, and (4) delete the zone. The script is quiet by default (outputting only a tab delimited list of DNS records). If you want to see what's going on add the `--verbose` flag to your command. The request is totally passive since Cloudflare runs the test on their end. <br><br>

```sh
indy@mac > ./cloudfish.py -k de567yuhgfr567yhg -e indy@example.com -a 3456ygfe3456ygf -d yahoo.com --verbose

## Documentation

```sh
indy@mac > ./cloudfish.py -h     
usage: cloudfish -d [domain] -k [globalkey] -e [email on cloudflare] -a [cloudflare account number]

Find subdomains with Cloudflare.

required arguments:
  -k ff86g56783...   Provide your Cloudflare global key
  -d example.com     Provide a domain to enumerate (no subdomains)
  -e john@email.com  Provide email on your Cloudflare account
  -a u3nd92ldhs...   Provide your Cloudflare account number

optional arguments:
  --verbose          Noisy output with banner and step by step updates
```

## Importing as a Module

```python
import cloudfish

# Call cloudfish
dns = cloudfish.cloudfish()
# Retrieve the records
#Data order is:	       domain,    global key,                  email,             account id,                  verbose (True|False)
records = dns.records('yahoo.com','hu76tghu76tghju76tghu76tgh','indy@example.com','ghu76tghji8765edfghji98765',False)

for record in records:
    columns = record.split('|')
    type = columns[0]
    name = columns[1]
    value = columns[2]

    if type == "CNAME":
        print(name+" => "+value)

```

When the raw response is returned to your variable it will be a list seperated by record. The records will have `|` seperating each column `type`,`name`, and `value`. From here you can filter it however you'd like. In the example above I filtered just the `CNAME` records and printed the results. 

## Inspiration
Back in 2016, [Matthew Bryant](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer) released [`cloudflare_enum`](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/cloudflare_enum/), which made use of Cloudflare's automatic DNS scanner to find subdomains for pentesting against targets. I stumbled across Cloudflare's DNS scanner and did manual testing for a while. Eventually I found the `cloudflare_enum` project, but I realize it was completely broken given its age. Since I still needed an automated way to use Cloudflare's DNS scanner I wrote a new script using the Cloudflare API v4. Enjoy!
